# Worldwide Box Office Gross Linear Model

This project consists of a spider to scrape data from IMDB and Box Office Mojo which is later then used to construct a regression model. This regression model attempts to predict worldwide box office gross for films with publically available information. It also limits its information to that available before the release of the film.
